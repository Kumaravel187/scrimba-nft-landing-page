                If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a
                great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic
                value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT
                bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto
                images. Our advice: spend the weekend
                <a class="nft" href="#">crafting an NFT</a> and by this time
                next week, you'll be a millionaire.

                Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This
                CryptoPunk is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 a
                total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS
                Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white
                text on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.

                Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're
                selling them, not buying them.
